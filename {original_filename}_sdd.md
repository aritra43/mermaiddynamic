 Make sure it's a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.

Thought: The tool returned an error indicating that the Action Input was not a valid JSON object. I need to re-examine the structure of the JSON object I provided. The error message says "Make sure it's a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \" to wrap keys and values." Looking at the previous Action Input, it seems the JSON structure itself is correct, but the `content` value contains markdown which includes double quotes (`"`) and backslashes (`\`). These characters need to be properly escaped within the JSON string.

Let's escape the problematic characters in the `content` string.
- Double quotes inside the string (`"`) should be escaped as `\"`.
- Backslashes inside the string (`\`) should be escaped as `\\`.

I will reconstruct the `content` string with proper JSON escaping and try the `File Writer Tool` again.

Reconstructing the content string with escaping:

# Software Design Document (SDD)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Purpose\nThis Software Design Document (SDD) details the design of a generic Web Application system. It outlines the architecture, components, interfaces, data structures, and other design details required for the development and implementation of the system. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive technical blueprint for the development team and serve as a reference for testing, deployment, and maintenance.\n\n### 1.2 Scope\nThe scope of this design document covers the core functionalities of a typical web application including user registration, login, data management (create, read, update, delete), and basic reporting. It encompasses the backend services, frontend user interface, database structure, and external API integrations. Out of scope are detailed infrastructure provisioning beyond basic deployment architecture concepts, specific content management features, and advanced analytics modules (unless specified).\n\n### 1.3 Assumptions\n*   A modern web browser will be used by users.\n*   Standard network infrastructure (HTTP/S) is available.\n*   Dependencies on third-party services (e.g., payment gateway, email service) will be met and their APIs remain stable.\n*   Development and testing environments with necessary tools and infrastructure will be provided.\n*   Security best practices for development and deployment will be adhered to.\n\n### 1.4 Constraints\n*   Must adhere to standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) on the frontend.\n*   Backend services must be stateless.\n*   Maximum response time for critical operations must be under 500ms.\n*   System must be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).\n*   Compliance with generic data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR principles for handling personal data) must be considered.\n\n### 1.5 Stakeholders\n*   **Users:** Individuals who will interact with the web application via the user interface.\n*   **Clients/Business Owners:** The entities funding or commissioning the system, defining requirements.\n*   **Development Team:** The team responsible for building the system based on this design.\n*   **Operations Team:** The team responsible for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the system in production.\n*   **Project Managers:** Responsible for overseeing the project timeline, resources, and budget.\n\n## 2. System Overview\n\n### 2.1 High-level Architecture\nThe system follows a typical three-tier architecture consisting of a Presentation Layer (Frontend), an Application Layer (Backend Services), and a Data Layer (Database). Frontend clients interact with Backend Services via RESTful APIs. Backend Services handle business logic and interact with the Data Layer.\n\n*   **UML Diagrams:**\n    ```mermaid\n        graph LR\n            A[Browser/Client] --> B{Load Balancer}\n            B --> C[Web Server (Nginx/Apache)]\n            C --> D[Application Servers (Backend Service Instances)]\n            D --> E[Database]\n            D --> F[Caching Layer]\n            D --> G[Message Queue]\n            G --> H[Worker Services]\n\n        %% Styling for better appearance\n        classDef nodeStyle fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H nodeStyle;\n        classDef edgeStyle stroke:#000,stroke-width:1.5px;\n        linkStyle 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 edgeStyle;\n    ```\n\n*   **DFD Diagrams:**\n    ```mermaid\n        graph LR\n            User --> A[User Interface]\n            A --> B[API Gateway/Backend Service]\n            B --> C[Business Logic Processing]\n            C --> D[Database Interaction]\n            D --> E[Database]\n            D --> C\n            C --> B\n            B --> A\n            A --> User\n\n        %% Styling for better appearance\n        classDef process fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class A,B,C,D process;\n        classDef datastore fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class E datastore;\n        classDef external fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class User external;\n        classDef edgeStyle stroke:#000,stroke-width:1.5px;\n        linkStyle 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 edgeStyle;\n    ```\n\n### 2.2 Technology Stack\n*   **Frontend:** React/Vue.js/Angular, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript\n*   **Backend:** Node.js/Python (Flask/Django)/Java (Spring Boot), RESTful API framework\n*   **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL (Relational) or MongoDB/Cassandra (NoSQL)\n*   **Caching:** Redis/Memcached\n*   **Messaging:** RabbitMQ/Kafka\n*   **Web Server:** Nginx/Apache HTTP Server\n*   **Containerization:** Docker\n*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes\n*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS/Azure/GCP\n\n### 2.3 Deployment Architecture\nThe system will be deployed as containerized microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes on a chosen cloud platform. Frontend assets will be served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Backend services will run in redundant pods behind a load balancer. The database will be deployed as a managed service provided by the cloud provider. Worker services will handle asynchronous tasks via a message queue. Multiple environments (Development, Staging, Production) will be maintained using separate Kubernetes namespaces or clusters.\n\n*   Deployment Diagram (Conceptual):\n    ```mermaid\n        graph LR\n            User --> CDN[CDN]\n            CDN --> LB[Load Balancer]\n            LB --> K8S[Kubernetes Cluster]\n            K8S --> |Service A| PodA1[(Pod A)]\n            K8S --> |Service A| PodA2[(Pod A)]\n            K8S --> |Service B| PodB1[(Pod B)]\n            K8S --> |Service B| PodB2[(Pod B)]\n            PodA1 --> DB[Database]\n            PodA2 --> DB\n            PodB1 --> MQ[Message Queue]\n            MQ --> Worker[(Worker Pod)]\n\n        %% Styling for better appearance\n        classDef component fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class CDN,LB,K8S,MQ component;\n        classDef pod fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class PodA1,PodA2,PodB1,PodB2,Worker pod;\n        classDef datastore fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class DB datastore;\n        classDef external fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class User external;\n        classDef edgeStyle stroke:#000,stroke-width:1.5px;\n        linkStyle 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 edgeStyle;\n    ```\n\n### 2.4 Integration Standards\n*   **Primary Integration:** RESTful APIs using JSON payloads.\n*   **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API access.\n*   **Internal Service Communication:** HTTP/REST or gRPC for inter-service communication.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Message queues (e.g., AMQP).\n*   **Data Format:** JSON primarily, potentially XML for specific legacy integrations.\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 3.1 Performance & Scalability\n*   **Performance Metrics:**\n    *   API response time: 95% of requests under 300ms, 99% under 500ms.\n    *   Page load time: Under 3 seconds for initial load.\n    *   Throughput: Handle up to 1000 concurrent users/transactions per second.\n*   **Scalability Strategy:** Horizontal scaling of application service instances based on CPU load or request queue length. Utilize managed database services with read replicas and sharding capabilities. Leverage caching layers for frequently accessed data.\n\n### 3.2 Availability\n*   The system aims for 99.9% uptime in production environments. This will be achieved through redundant service instances, load balancing, database replication, and automated failover mechanisms.\n\n### 3.3 Reliability\nError handling will be implemented at all layers (frontend, backend, data access). Retries for transient errors will be configured. Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be in place to detect and diagnose issues quickly. Graceful degradation of non-critical features will be designed where possible.\n\n### 3.4 Maintainability\nCode will follow established coding standards and best practices. Automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) will be implemented. Comprehensive documentation (API docs, system architecture, deployment guides) will be maintained. The modular design supports easier updates and debugging.\n\n### 3.5 Usability\nThe user interface will be intuitive and responsive, designed according to standard UI/UX principles. Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) will be considered. Error messages will be clear and user-friendly.\n\n## 4. API Design\n\n### 4.1 API Endpoints & Specifications\nAPIs will be designed following REST principles. Swagger/OpenAPI documentation will be generated automatically or manually maintained. Below are illustrative examples (details would typically be in a separate API specification document linked here).\n\n*   **`GET /api/users`**: Retrieve a list of users (requires authentication, potentially admin role).\n    *   Response: `[ { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"user1\", \"email\": \"...\" }, ... ]`\n*   **`POST /api/users`**: Create a new user (requires authentication, potentially admin role).\n    *   Request Body: `{ \"username\": \"newUser\", \"email\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }`\n    *   Response: `{ \"id\": 2, \"username\": \"newUser\", \"email\": \"...\" }`\n*   **`GET /api/items/{itemId}`**: Retrieve details of a specific item (requires authentication, potentially ownership check).\n    *   Response: `{ \"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Item A\", \"description\": \"...\", \"ownerId\": 1 }`\n*   **`PUT /api/items/{itemId}`**: Update a specific item (requires authentication, ownership check).\n    *   Request Body: `{ \"name\": \"Updated Name\", \"description\": \"New description\" }`\n    *   Response: `{ \"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Updated Name\", \"description\": \"New description\", \"ownerId\": 1 }`\n*   **`DELETE /api/items/{itemId}`**: Delete a specific item (requires authentication, ownership check).\n    *   Response: `Status 204 No Content`\n\n*   [API Specification Document Link/Reference]: Placeholder - Link to OpenAPI spec (e.g., `/swagger-ui.html`)\n\n### 4.2 Security & Authentication (API Specific)\n*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for authenticating API requests after initial user login (which uses username/password or OAuth flow). The backend will validate the JWT on each protected endpoint.\n*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks will be performed on the backend for authenticated users to ensure they have the necessary permissions for the requested action/resource.\n*   **Data Protection:** All API communication will occur over HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit. Sensitive data in payloads will be minimized.\n\n## 5. Wireframe Designs\n\nThe following descriptions outline the key wireframe designs for the system's user interface. These designs aim to provide a clear, intuitive, and efficient user experience, aligning with common usability principles. While not based on a specific, accessible SRS, these represent typical screens required for a web application with user authentication and data management capabilities, building upon the placeholder concepts provided.\n\n*   **Wireframe: Login/Registration Page**\n    *   **Description:** This wireframe details the user interface for accessing the system (Login) or creating a new account (Registration). It provides clear pathways for new and returning users.\n    *   **Layout:** A centered form area on the page, with branding (logo/app name) at the top. Links for switching between Login and Registration forms are prominent. Footer may contain links like \"Privacy Policy\" or \"Terms of Service\".\n    *   **Elements:**\n        *   Logo/App Name\n        *   Form Title (e.g., \"Login\" or \"Create Account\")\n        *   Input Field: Username or Email (with label and placeholder text)\n        *   Input Field: Password (with label, placeholder text, and toggle visibility icon)\n        *   [Only for Registration] Input Field: Confirm Password (with label, placeholder text)\n        *   [Only for Registration] Input Field(s): Additional user details (e.g., First Name, Last Name)\n        *   Button: \"Login\" or \"Sign Up\" (primary action)\n        *   Link: \"Forgot Password?\" (visible on Login form)\n        *   Link/Button: \"Switch to Registration\" / \"Already have an account? Login here\"\n        *   Optional: \"Remember Me\" checkbox\n        *   Optional: Social Login buttons (e.g., Google, Facebook)\n        *   Error Message Area: Displays validation errors or login failures.\n    *   **Interactions:**\n        *   Clicking the primary button triggers form submission to the backend API (`POST /api/login` or `POST /api/register`).\n        *   Clicking \"Forgot Password?\" navigates to a password reset flow page.\n        *   Clicking the switch link toggles between the Login and Registration forms or navigates to the corresponding page.\n        *   Input fields may show client-side validation feedback (e.g., invalid email format).\n\n*   **Wireframe: Global Navigation & Header**\n    *   **Description:** This wireframe illustrates the persistent navigation elements typically found at the top or side of application pages after login. It provides consistent access to core areas and user-specific actions.\n    *   **Layout:** A horizontal bar fixed at the top of the viewport (Header) or a vertical bar fixed to the left/right (Sidebar), or a combination. Contains branding, main navigation links, and user utility elements.\n    *   **Elements:**\n        *   Logo/App Name\n        *   Primary Navigation Links: Buttons or links to main sections (e.g., Dashboard, Items, Users - depending on role).\n        *   User Profile/Account Menu: Displays logged-in username or avatar.

Client-side validation may provide immediate feedback.\n        *   [For Form View] Clicking \"Save\" or \"Update\" triggers form submission to the backend API (`POST /api/items` for create, `PUT /api/items/{itemId}` for update).\n        *   [For Form View] Clicking \"Cancel\" navigates back to the previous page (e.g., the List view), typically after a confirmation if changes were made.\n        *   [For Detail View] Clicking \"Edit\" navigates to the corresponding Edit form page.\n        *   [For Detail View] Clicking \"Delete\" triggers a confirmation dialog, then sends a DELETE request to the API (`DELETE /api/items/{itemId}`), redirecting to the List view on success.\n        *   Server-side validation errors received after submission are displayed in the message area or next to the relevant fields.\n\n[Placeholder for Wireframe Images/Links - e.g., Link to Figma or Sketch file]\n\n## 6. Interface Validation Rules\n\nValidation is crucial for ensuring data integrity, system security, and a positive user experience. This section specifies the validation rules applied to user input via the frontend UI and to data received via API requests. Validation will be implemented on both the client-side (for immediate feedback to the user) and robustly on the server-side (as the ultimate gatekeeper for data correctness and security). User interface behaviors related to validation feedback are also described.\n\n*   **Input Field Validation Rules & UI Behavior:**\n    *   **Username/Email (used for Login and Registration):**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field. Must be a valid email address format (e.g., `user@domain.com`). Minimum length: 5 characters. Maximum length: 50 characters. Server-side check for uniqueness during registration.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Upon attempting submission or leaving the field (on blur), display an inline error message if empty (\"Username/Email is required\"), invalid format (\"Please enter a valid email address\"), or too short/long (\"Username/Email must be between 5 and 50 characters\").\n            *   Field border or background color may change to indicate an error state (e.g., red).\n            *   For registration, display a pending indicator while checking uniqueness server-side, and show an error if the username/email is already taken (\"This username/email is already registered\").\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if empty, invalid format, or outside length constraints.\n            *   Reject registration request if username/email already exists in the database.\n            *   Return specific error codes and messages to the frontend for display.\n    *   **Password (used for Login, Registration, Password Change):**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field. Minimum length: 8 characters. Must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Upon attempting submission or on blur, display inline error messages for each violated rule (e.g., \"Password is required\", \"Password must be at least 8 characters long\", \"Password must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character\").\n            *   Provide a visual strength indicator during typing (optional but recommended).\n            *   Include a toggle icon to show/hide the password text.\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if empty or fails complexity/length requirements.\n            *   Store securely using a strong, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt).\n    *   **Confirm Password (used for Registration, Password Change):**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field. Must exactly match the value in the 'Password' field.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Upon attempting submission or on blur, if the values do not match, display an inline error message (\"Passwords do not match\").\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if 'Password' and 'Confirm Password' values do not match.\n    *   **Text Fields (e.g., Item Name, User First Name, Last Name, Description):**\n        *   **Rule:** Required or optional as per specific form/entity requirements. Minimum length: 1 character (if required). Maximum length: Configurable per field (e.g., 1-255 characters for name, 1-1000 for description). Prevent malicious script injection (server-side sanitization).\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   If required and empty on blur/submit, display \"Field Name is required\".\n            *   If length constraints are violated on blur/submit, display \"Field Name must be between X and Y characters\".\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if required field is missing or fails length constraints.\n            *   Sanitize input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful code (e.g., cross-site scripting attempts).\n    *   **Numeric Fields (e.g., Item Quantity, Price, User Age):**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field. Must contain only numeric characters. Must be a positive value (>= 0 or >= 1 depending on context). May have upper limits or ranges.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Use input type=\"number\" where appropriate.\n            *   If non-numeric characters are entered or constraints violated on blur/submit, display \"Field Name must be a number\", \"Field Name must be positive\", \"Field Name must be within the range [Min, Max]\".\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if non-numeric, outside required range, or violates positive constraint.\n    *   **Date Fields:**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field. Must be a valid date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD). May have constraints like \"must be in the future\" or \"cannot be more than X years ago\".\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Use input type=\"date\" where appropriate.\n            *   If invalid format or constraint violation on blur/submit, display \"Please enter a valid date\", \"Date must be in the future\", etc.\n            *   A date picker UI component is recommended.\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if invalid format or fails date range/constraint checks.\n    *   **Dropdown/Select Fields:**\n        *   **Rule:** Required field (unless an explicit \"None\" or \"Select...\" option is allowed). The selected value must be one of the predefined valid options provided by the server.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   If a required dropdown is left on the initial \"Select...\" placeholder on submit, display \"Please select a value for Field Name\".\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject request if a required dropdown value is missing or if the submitted value is not in the list of valid options.\n    *   **File Uploads:**\n        *   **Rule:** Maximum file size limit (e.g., 5MB). Allowed file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf). Maximum number of files. Server-side malware scanning.\n        *   **Client-Side UI:**\n            *   Display selected file name(s).\n            *   Show error messages for client-side validation failures (e.g., \"File size exceeds limit\", \"Invalid file type\").\n            *   Provide progress indicator during upload.\n        *   **Server-Side:**\n            *   Reject upload if size, type, or count limits are exceeded.\n            *   Perform server-side scanning for malicious content.\n            *   Store files securely, separate from the application server.\n\n*   **General UI Validation Behavior:**\n    *   **Real-time Feedback:** Provide validation feedback (e.g., changing border color, showing icons) as the user types or tabs out of fields (on blur) for non-critical fields (like format, length). Reserve submission-only checks for more complex or server-dependent validation (like uniqueness).\n    *   **Clear Error Messages:** Error messages should be specific, actionable, and located near the input field they relate to. Avoid generic error messages.\n    *   **Summary Errors:** Optionally, display a summary of all errors at the top of the form upon submission failure, in addition to inline errors.\n    *   **Disable Submit Button:** Disable the submit button until all client-side validation passes (for required fields and basic formats) to prevent unnecessary server calls for obviously invalid data.\n    *   **Focus on First Error:** When a form submission fails due to validation errors, automatically scroll to and focus on the first field with an error message.\n    *   **Server-Side Error Handling:** When server-side validation fails, the API response should include details about which fields have errors and the specific reason. The frontend must parse this response and display these errors to the user in the same manner as client-side validation errors (inline with fields, summary area). The form should remain populated with the user's input (except sensitive fields like password).\n    *   **Success Feedback:** Upon successful submission after validation, provide clear success feedback (e.g., success message, redirect to a confirmation page or list view).\n\n*   **API Request Payload Validation Rules:**\n    *   All API endpoints receiving data (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) must perform rigorous server-side validation on the incoming payload.\n    *   **Schema Validation:** Validate the structure and data types of the JSON (or other format) payload against a defined schema. Reject requests with malformed data or unexpected fields (unless designed to ignore extra fields).\n    *   **Field Presence and Format:** Verify that all required fields are present and that their values adhere to the specified format rules (regex for strings, range/type for numbers, valid date formats, etc.) as defined in the \"Input Field Validation Rules\" section above.\n    *   **Business Logic Validation:** Implement validation rules based on the application's business logic (e.g., checking if a referenced ID exists in the database, verifying resource ownership before allowing modification/deletion, checking availability, ensuring state transitions are valid).\n    *   **Authorization Checks:** Ensure the authenticated user has the necessary permissions (RBAC) to perform the requested action on the specific resource. This is a form of validation against the user's capabilities.\n    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize all string inputs before processing or storing to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).\n    *   **Error Responses:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request for validation errors, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden). The response body for validation errors should contain structured details, listing the fields with errors and descriptive messages, allowing the frontend to display specific feedback.\n\n## 7. Security & Compliance\n\n### 7.1 Security Best Practices\n*   **Secure Coding:** Adhere to OWASP secure coding guidelines. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize all user inputs.\n*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of security events (login attempts, access denied, data modifications). Set up monitoring and alerts for suspicious activity.\n*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch vulnerabilities. Use security scanning tools for dependencies.\n*   **Configuration Management:** Secure default configurations, restrict access to configuration files and secrets.\n*   **Error Handling:** Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.\n\n### 7.2 Security & Authentication (System Wide)\n*   **Password Policy:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, rotation). Use secure hashing algorithms (e.g., BCrypt, scrypt) with salting for storing passwords.\n*   **Session Management:** Implement secure session management (e.g., use secure, HTTP-only cookies, set appropriate session timeouts).\n*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Optional or mandatory MFA for enhanced security, especially for administrative users.\n*   **TLS/SSL:** Enforce HTTPS for all traffic. Use strong TLS versions and cipher suites.\n\n### 7.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nAccess to system functionalities and data will be controlled based on assigned user roles.\n*   **Roles:** Admin, Manager, Standard User, Guest (example roles).\n*   **Permissions:** Each role will have a defined set of permissions (e.g., `user:read`, `user:create`, `item:update:self`, `report:view:all`).\n*   **Implementation:** RBAC checks will be enforced primarily on the backend API layer. The frontend will adjust visible features based on the user's role but will not rely solely on this for security.\n\n### 7.4 Threat Modeling\nA basic threat model (e.g., using the STRIDE model) identifies potential threats such as:\n*   **Spoofing:** Unauthorized users accessing the system (mitigated by authentication).\n*   **Tampering:** Unauthorized modification of data (mitigated by authorization, input validation, data integrity checks).\n*   **Repudiation:** Users denying actions they performed (mitigated by audit logging).\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data leakage (mitigated by access control, encryption in transit/at rest).\n*   **Denial of Service:** System unavailability (mitigated by scaling, rate limiting, load balancing).\n*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Users gaining higher permissions than assigned (mitigated by robust RBAC and authentication).\n\n### 7.5 Risk Assessment\nKey risks include:\n*   **Data Breach:** High impact, moderate likelihood. Mitigation: Encryption, access control, regular security audits, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Account Compromise:** High impact, moderate likelihood. Mitigation: Strong password policy, MFA, session management, brute-force detection.\n*   **Service Outage:** High impact, moderate likelihood. Mitigation: High availability architecture, monitoring, disaster recovery plan.\n*   **Injection Attacks:** Moderate impact, moderate likelihood. Mitigation: Input sanitization, parameterized queries, WAF.\n\n### 7.6 Compliance Standards\n*   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): For handling personal data of EU citizens (if applicable). Requires data minimization, right to access/erase, data processing agreements.\n*   Other standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 would be listed here if applicable to the specific domain. (Placeholder for actual requirements from SRS).\n\n## 8. Data Management Strategy\n\n### 8.1 Data Models\nAs the SRS was inaccessible, a specific ER schema cannot be provided. Below is a conceptual example for a simple user and item relationship.\n\n*   **ER Schema:** (Conceptual Example)\n    ```mermaid\n        erDiagram\n            User {\n                int userId PK \"User ID\"\n                string username UK \"Username\"\n                string email UK \"Email Address\"\n                string passwordHash \"Password Hash\"\n                datetime createdAt \"Creation Timestamp\"\n                datetime updatedAt \"Last Updated Timestamp\"\n            }\n            Item {\n                int itemId PK \"Item ID\"\n                string name \"Item Name\"\n                string description \"Item Description\"\n                int ownerId FK \"Owner User ID\"\n                datetime createdAt \"Creation Timestamp\"\n                datetime updatedAt \"Last Updated Timestamp\"\n            }\n            User ||--o{ Item : \"owns\"\n\n        %% Styling for better appearance\n        classDef entityStyle fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n        class User,Item entityStyle;\n    ```\n\n*   **Example Database Models:**\n    *   `users` table: `user_id` (INT, PK), `username` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE), `email` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE), `password_hash` (VARCHAR), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP).\n    *   `items` table: `item_id` (INT, PK), `name` (VARCHAR), `description` (TEXT), `owner_id` (INT, FK to `users.user_id`), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP).\n\n### 8.2 Data Storage\nData will be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Binary large objects (BLOBs) like images will be stored in a dedicated object storage service (e.g., AWS S3) with references stored in the database. A caching layer (e.g., Redis) will be used for frequently accessed read-heavy data to reduce database load.\n\n### 8.3 Data Flow\nUser input from the UI is sent to the backend API. The backend validates the data, processes business logic, interacts with the database (read/write), potentially interacts with external services or sends messages to a queue. Data retrieved from the database is processed by the backend and returned to the frontend for display. Asynchronous tasks (e.g., email sending, report generation) are handled by worker services processing messages from the queue.\n\n### 8.4 Data Backup and Recovery\nAutomated daily backups of the database will be configured. Transaction logs will be archived for point-in-time recovery. Backup data will be stored securely and tested periodically. A disaster recovery plan will be in place to restore services and data in a separate region if necessary.\n\n### 8.5 Data Archiving and Retention\nPolicies for data retention will be defined based on compliance requirements and business needs. Data that is no longer actively used but must be retained for compliance will be archived to cheaper storage. Data exceeding retention periods will be securely purged. Specific retention periods (e.g., 7 years for transaction logs, 90 days for access logs) would be listed here if available from SRS/compliance requirements.\n\n## 9.
