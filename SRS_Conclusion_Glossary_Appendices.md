# 5. Conclusion

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document has outlined the functional and non-functional requirements for the Healthcare Appointment Scheduling System (HASS).  The document details the system's features, user interactions, and performance expectations.  Successful implementation of these requirements will result in a system that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of appointment scheduling and patient record management.
