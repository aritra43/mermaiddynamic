| Assumption                               | Description                                                                                                  | Justification                                                                                                    | Impact if Assumption is False                                                                          | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic Arithmetic Operations are Sufficient | The calculator only needs to support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). | The requirements document specifies this as the scope of the project.                                           | The calculator would lack functionality, potentially rendering it unusable for some users.                    | Expand functionality in future iterations.                                                                        |
| User Interface Simplicity is Acceptable   | A simple text-based or basic GUI user interface is sufficient.                                                  | This aligns with the project's goal of creating a simple calculator.                                             | The calculator might be less user-friendly or less appealing.                                                 | Develop a more sophisticated UI later, or explore different UI frameworks.                                     |
| Standard Math Libraries are Available     | Standard mathematical libraries will be available and compatible with the chosen programming language.         | This is a common assumption for software development.                                                            | The project may require significant modifications to handle mathematical operations without libraries.          | Evaluate alternative methods for handling arithmetic calculations. Select a programming language with suitable libraries. |
| Sufficient Computing Resources are Available| The target system has enough computing resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run the application.               | Typical for software development.                                                                               | The application might not run or perform poorly.                                                              | Test on various hardware configurations and specify minimum requirements.                                       |
| Users will Input Valid Data              | Users will enter valid numerical data and will not intentionally attempt to break the application.     | This is a common assumption in software design; however, robust error handling should still be implemented. | Unexpected errors might occur leading to application crashes or unpredictable behavior.                        | Implement robust error handling and input validation.                                                          |

### Dependencies

| Dependency                     | Description                                                                                       | Type             | Status    | Impact if Dependency Fails                                                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Programming Language           | The chosen programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++)                                          | Software         | Defined    | Project cannot proceed without a programming language.                                              | Select a stable, widely used language with adequate libraries and community support.             |
| Standard Math Libraries       | Libraries for providing basic mathematical operations.                                               | Software         | Defined    | Application will not function correctly without these libraries.                                    | Use an alternative math library or develop custom functions to replace functionality as needed. |
| Development Tools             | IDE, compiler, debugger, version control system (e.g., Git).                                       | Software         | Defined    | Development will be significantly slower and more difficult.                                       | Use alternative development tools or upgrade existing ones.                                     |
| Operating System               | Operating system on which the application will run (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).                 | Software         | Defined    | Application will not be portable if there are OS-specific dependencies.                            | Test on all target platforms.                                                                 |
| User Interface Framework (if applicable) | Framework for creating the user interface (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Swing).                            | Software         | Defined    | UI development will be more complicated and time-consuming without a UI framework.               | Use a different UI framework.                                                                 |
