## 1.3 Overview

The Healthcare Appointment Scheduling System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of scheduling appointments between patients and healthcare providers. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for both patients and providers, allowing for efficient appointment management and access to critical medical information.  The system is expected to improve patient care by providing easy access to scheduling and medical records, and by providing healthcare providers with a centralized system for managing appointments and patient information.  Further details on specific features and functionalities are outlined in subsequent sections of this document.

## UML Diagrams

The provided document is an SRS, not a BRD.  A complete BRD is needed to generate accurate and complete UML diagrams.  The following diagrams are placeholders and will be incomplete without the necessary information from a BRD.  Specifically, a BRD would provide details about the system's actors, use cases, classes, components, and system architecture.  Without this information, the diagrams will be highly speculative and likely inaccurate.
